A sequence of numbers (or a function) is monotone if it is either always increasing or always decreasing. It is strictly monotone if it is strictly increasing or decreasing. 

In the context that is presented here, we are only ever concerned with discrete and distinct numbers, so only strict inequality makes sense. It is a fancy word to mean one-directional, without the direction being specified.
