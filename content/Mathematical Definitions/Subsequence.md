A subsequence is a sequence that can be extracted from another, larger sequence, by selecting only some of the items in the sequence. For example, the sequence $1,3,5,6,7$ is a subsequence of the sequence $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$. It is essential that the order is unchanged, and no items that were not in the original sequence are included.
