An exclamation mark following a number denotes what is called a factorial. This notation is used as shorthand for a number shouting loud (not really) by multiplying itself with all the positive integers smaller than itself. For example, 
$$4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24 .$$
In general, for any positive integer $n$, its factorial is defined as
$$n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \ldots \times 1.$$
