This is a turn-based cooperative game, where the players work together to beat the game. There is a deck of 98 cards that need to be placed in 4 piles according to some rules, and the game is won when all the cards have been placed in the piles. 

The setup and rules of the game are shown <a href="https://www.boardgamecapital.com/game_rules/the-game.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. We refer to the ruleset regarding the numbers as $\cal R$, presented below:

> [!Abstract] Original game ruleset $\cal R$
> - In an ascending (resp. descending) pile of cards, the number of each card placed must always be greater (resp. smaller) than the card laid before it.
> - You can place a card on an ascending (resp. descending) pile when the number card is exactly 10 less (resp. greater) than the number shown on the pile. We refer to this rule as the **10-trick**. 
> - While there are cards left in the deck, a player must play at least 2 cards on their turn. 
> - When there are no cards left in the deck, a player must play at least 1 card on their turn.
