The function $L(N)$ is defined [[A subsequence formulation#^defLN|here]] as the LUB of mutually exclusive monotone subsequences for a for any sequence comprised of $N$ distinct numbers. 

Out of interest, I calculated $L(N)$ for $N$ up to $1000$. The results are shown on the graph below:

This is somewhat reminiscent of other growth graphs, which will be looked into. In any case, the rate of growth decreases as $N$ increases which makes sense intuitively, as square numbers grow more and more sparse.
